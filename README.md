## Data Engineering and Processing Pipeline

The ingestion layer translates raw, heterogeneous data formats into structured, multi-dimensional grids:

### 1. Daily Binary Decoding
* **Precipitation:** Reads IMD 0.25° gridded daily binary files (`.grd`). It reads a single-precision float array of size 129x135, georeferences it to the Indian subcontinent bounding box (Lat 6.5°N - 38.5°N | Lon 66.5°E - 100.0°E), and masks missing data flags (`99.9` or `-99.9` to `NaN`).
* **Temperature:** Reads IMD 1.0° gridded daily maximum and minimum binary files (`.grd`). It reads a single-precision float array of size 31x31, georeferences it to the bounding box (Lat 7.5°N - 37.5°N | Lon 67.5°E - 97.5°E), and masks invalid values (`-999.0` to `NaN`).
* **Storage Compilation:** Aggregates daily grids along the time axis into CF-compliant NetCDF4 (`.nc`) files.

### 2. Geostationary Satellite Integration
* Assimilates geostationary satellite telemetry from MOSDAC INSAT-3D/3DR (L2B SST, LST, and precipitation products in HDF5 format).
* Implements background scripts (`scripts/download_and_decode_all_real.py`) to scrape, regrid, and align satellite coordinates with the ground observation grid.

### 3. Strict Administrative Boundary Masking
* **Methodology:** Implemented in `src/spatial_predictions.py` via `mask_region_boundary_local`. It extracts administrative boundaries from `data/india_states.geojson` and constructs matplotlib `Path` vector polygons for the selected pilot state (e.g. Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha).
* **Operation:** Evaluates a 2D coordinate grid of latitude and longitude coordinates. Points lying outside the boundary polygon are set to `NaN` using:
  ```python
  points = np.column_stack((lon_grid.ravel(), lat_grid.ravel()))
  mask = path.contains_points(points).reshape(lat_grid.shape)
  data_array = data_array.where(mask, np.nan)
  ```
  This prevents grid calculations from leaking into neighboring states or oceans, maintaining regional integrity for localized water and agricultural modeling.

### 4. Data Ingestion Cron Orchestration
The ingestion pipeline automates daily file acquisition and regridding via Scheduled scripts (`scripts/download_and_decode_all_real.py`). The script:
1. Performs an HTTP GET query against IMD's daily reanalysis servers to retrieve the latest binary `.grd` records.
2. Applies a nearest-neighbor regridding interpolation to resolve coordinate spatial grids.
3. Appends the daily slices to the active, CF-compliant NetCDF4 archive on disk.
4. Updates NetCDF metadata parameters (time variables, scale factors, and add_offset values) to preserve historical data standards.

## Hybrid 5-Layer Forecast Engine

The spatial forecast engine (`src/spatial_predictions.py`) avoids compounding autoregressive drift through a hybrid 5-layer pipeline:

### Layer 1: PyTorch Spatio-Temporal ConvLSTM Anomaly Model
* **Architecture:** Swaps standard matrix multiplications in LSTM cells with 2D convolutions (kernel size 3x3, padding 1) to capture spatial correlations. Configured with 2 ConvLSTM layers (64 and 32 hidden dimensions).
* **Tensor Configuration:** Inputs are mapped as 5D tensors of shape:
  $$\text{Input Shape} = [B, T, C, H, W] = [\text{Batch}, 10 \text{ days}, 1 \text{ channel}, 129 \text{ lat}, 135 \text{ lon}]$$
* **Anomaly-Space Mapping:** Rather than predicting absolute values (which leads to severe dampening), the network predicts anomalies relative to daily climatological means.
  * **Rainfall Anomaly Scaling:** Log-transformed to handle extreme events:
    $$y = \text{sign}(x) \cdot \frac{\log(1 + |x|)}{3.0}$$
  * **Temperature Anomaly Scaling:** Standard-scaled:
    $$y = \frac{x}{10.0}$$
* **Stochastic Uncertainty Estimation:** Implements Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout during testing. The model performs multiple stochastic forward passes ($N=5$) with active dropout layers to generate standard deviation grids representing forecast confidence bounds ($\pm1\sigma$).

### Layer 2: Daily Climatological Reanalysis Atlas
* Computes daily climatology profiles by grouping historical grid observations (2015-2023) by day-of-year:
  $$\text{Climatology}(m, d) = \frac{1}{Y} \sum_{y=1}^{Y} \text{Observation}(y, m, d)$$
* Serves as a physical reference baseline to bound the neural network's predictions at longer horizons.

### Layer 3: NOAA CPC Spatial Analog Selection
* Identifies the three most spatially-similar historical 30-day windows by calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient ($r$) across valid (non-NaN) grid cells:
  $$r = \frac{\sum (X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y})}{\sqrt{\sum (X_i - \bar{X})^2 \sum (Y_i - \bar{Y})^2}}$$
* Yields the top 3 analog years and extracts their subsequent actual trajectories (Day +1 to Day +7) to form a physical analog ensemble.

### Layer 4: Exponential Blending Schedule
* Blends the ConvLSTM neural anomaly prediction, the analog year ensemble mean, and the historical climatological grid.
* The neural component's weight decreases exponentially over the forecast window ($w_{\text{neural}} = 0.55 \cdot 0.88^t$), while the analog and climatology weights increase, stabilizing predictions up to Day +7.

### Layer 5: Mean Bias Correction (MBC)
* Calculates the spatial mean ratio of the climatological grid to the blended grid, applying the scaling factor to adjust regional biases:
  $$\text{CorrectedGrid} = \text{BlendedGrid} \cdot \left( \frac{\text{Mean}(\text{ClimGrid})}{\text{Mean}(\text{BlendedGrid})} \right)$$

## Meteorological and Hydrological Indices

The engine (`src/climate_indices.py`) evaluates real-time data to derive high-level decision support indexes:

### 1. WMO Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI-30 & SPI-90)
* Measures meteorological drought and moisture surplus on 30-day and 90-day scales.
* Fits a two-parameter Gamma probability density function to the historical cumulative rainfall:
  $$g(x) = \frac{1}{\beta^\alpha \Gamma(\alpha)} x^{\alpha - 1} e^{-x/\beta}$$
  where $\alpha$ is the shape parameter, $\beta$ is the scale parameter, and $\Gamma(\alpha)$ is the gamma function.
* Transforms the cumulative probability $G(x)$ to a standard normal distribution (mean 0, variance 1):
  $$\text{SPI} = \Psi^{-1}(G(x))$$
* **Drought Categories:** Values $\le -1.0$ indicate moderate drought, $\le -1.5$ severe, and $\le -2.0$ extreme drought.

### 2. FAO-56 Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI)
* Estimates agricultural water stress by tracking actual vs. potential evapotranspiration ($ET$):
  $$\text{CWSI} = 1.0 - \frac{ET_{\text{actual}}}{ET_{\text{potential}}}$$
  where $ET_{\text{potential}}$ is derived using the Penman-Monteith equation for reference crop evapotranspiration ($ET_0$).
* Indicates crop stress on a scale from 0.0 (no stress) to 1.0 (water-deficit stress).

### 3. NWS Flash Flood Guidance (FFG)
* Estimates the volume of rainfall (mm/day) required to initiate local flooding.
* Calculates soil capacity limits by evaluating observed precipitation accumulations relative to the active soil moisture saturation percentage ($SM_{\%}$):
  $$\text{FFG} = \text{Capacity}_{\text{max}} \cdot (1.0 - SM_{\%})$$

### 4. Monsoon Onset and Northward Advance Tracker
* Evaluates waypoints using the IMD criteria: at least 5 consecutive days where the spatial mean daily rainfall over the waypoint exceeds $2.5\text{ mm/day}$, commencing after the earliest historical onset window.
* **Target Year Slicing:** Dynamically filters dataset records to the chosen target year. If the selection exceeds the dataset range (e.g. 2026), it falls back to the latest year of available observations (`2023`), updating all cards and headers dynamically.

## WMS Layer Integration Protocols

The GIS layer integrates real-time satellite data using the Web Map Service (WMS) protocol:
* **Endpoints:** Communicates with NASA GIBS (Global Imagery Browse Services) and JAXA servers.
* **Execution:** Resolves map layer views dynamically inside Plotly `Scattermap` maps. The client browser issues a standard `GetMap` query to fetch raster tiles projected under EPSG:3857 coordinate systems:
  `https://gibs.earthdata.nasa.gov/wms/epsg4326/best/wms.cgi?SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3.0&REQUEST=GetMap&BBOX={bbox-epsg-3857}&CRS=EPSG:3857&WIDTH=256&HEIGHT=256&LAYERS=LPRM_AMSR2_Surface_Soil_Moisture_C1_Band_Day_Daily&STYLES=&FORMAT=image/png&TRANSPARENT=true`
* The Soil Moisture layer is automatically requested without rigid static date parameters, allowing the WMS server to default to the latest available daily satellite composite.

## Model Verification and Skill Assessment

To evaluate forecast reliability, the platform implements holdout validation using observations from 2022-2023:

### 1. Brier Score and Brier Skill Score (BSS)
Evaluates the accuracy of probabilistic heavy rainfall forecasts ($>35\text{ mm/day}$):
* **Brier Score (BS):** Measures the mean squared error of probabilistic predictions:
  $$\text{BS} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N} (p_n - o_n)^2$$
  where $p_n$ is the forecasted probability and $o_n$ is the binary observation (1 if $>35\text{ mm}$, else 0).
* **Brier Skill Score (BSS):** Measures the relative improvement over climatological forecasts:
  $$\text{BSS} = 1.0 - \frac{\text{BS}_{\text{forecast}}}{\text{BS}_{\text{climatology}}}$$
  where the climatology score $\text{BS}_{\text{climatology}}$ is calculated by setting $p_n$ to the long-term historical probability of exceedance. A BSS $> 0$ indicates the model out-performs climatological probability.

### 2. Reliability Calibration Curves
Plots forecasted probabilities against observed frequencies across 10 bins. A perfectly calibrated model aligns along the $y=x$ diagonal line, revealing prediction biases (e.g., over-forecasting or under-forecasting).
